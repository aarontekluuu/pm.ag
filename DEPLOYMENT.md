2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**

   - Click **Add New**
   - Enter the variable name
   - Enter the value
   - Select the environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click **Save**
4. Redeploy your application for changes to take effect

## Local Development Setup

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
# Opinion API Configuration
OPINION_API_KEY=evrAQJBVkmc4r1A1o0nxtihakX2Epnxz
OPINION_OPENAPI_BASE_URL=https://proxy.opinion.trade:8443/openapi

# WalletConnect Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id

# Fee Wallet Address (EOA)
FEE_WALLET_ADDRESS=0x6facaf8776eac4ca7a3e1213e4fe66238da9bc4b
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:

1. The API is working by checking `/api/edges` endpoint
2. The response header `X-Data-Source` shows `api` (not `mock`)
3. Real market data is displayed on the dashboard
4. No errors appear in Vercel function logs

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** `.env.local` or `.env` files to git
- **Never set** `PRIVATE_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
- API keys are server-side only and never exposed to the client
- The `OPINION_API_KEY` is used only in server-side API routes
